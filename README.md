Our idea is to build a platform that allows users to access any website or product and pay only for the time used. This will be implemented using blockchain, which allows transactions of even less than a rupee.
For example I want to remove background from an image, now most of the websites who does this precisely are mostly paid and you dont want to take a monthly subscription just for 1 photo, so using our platform you can access that and pay just for the time used.
Websites or products can register their subscriptions on our platform, and users will be able to directly access those websites and get charged for the time used.
Currently, all the subscription models charge us for the entire month, even if we use them once or twice a month.
This will allow small SaaS platforms and developers to gain users who want to use the product but don't want to commit to a monthly subscription. Also, it can be used as an alternative to showing ads on the website and act as a new revenue model, which will be beneficial on both the developer and user sides.
Through our platform, users don't have to register individually on different websites, they can access the paid features of any website directly with just one click without entering any card information or worrying about setting up a payment method. They just need to top up their wallet connected to our platform, which will be used to automatically charge for their session time on all of the registered websites.
